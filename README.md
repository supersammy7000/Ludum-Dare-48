# Ludum Dare 48: Forest Adventure

Forest Adventure is a top down open world exploration game. You can explore 4 different biomes in the world each containing a different animal type. There is no objective in mind just explore the world and enjoy it.

This was my first time using PyGame and really enjoyed the process I learned a lot from this experience.
